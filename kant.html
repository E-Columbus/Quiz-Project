            <p>The father of relativism and the true enemy of Thomas Aquinas and metaphysical realism, while Ockham gave birth to conceptualism, that wasn't relativism, for he still believed we perceived the original version of reality, rather than a copy of it. Ockham's valuable, yet fragile stance was soon exploited by rationalists from the French revolution and eventually reached the Prussian empire, where Kant also discovered it.<br/><br/>

            Kant's ethics are organized around the notion of a “categorical imperative,” which is a universal ethical principle stating that one should always respect the humanity in others, and that one should only act in accordance with rules that could hold for everyone. Kant argued that the moral law is a truth of reason, and hence that all rational creatures are bound by the same moral law. Thus in answer to the question, “What should I do?” Kant replies that we should act rationally, in accordance with a universal moral law.<br/><br/>

            The most important element of Kant's mature metaphysics and epistemology is his doctrine of transcendental idealism, which received its fullest discussion in Critique of Pure Reason (1781/87). Transcendental idealism is the thesis that the empirical world that we experience (the “phenomenal” world of “appearances”) is to be distinguished from the world of things as they are in themselves. The most significant aspect of this distinction is that while the empirical world exists in space and time, things in themselves are neither spatial nor temporal. Transcendental idealism has wide-ranging consequences.<br/><br/>

            Kant argues that we cannot have knowledge of things in themselves. Further, since traditional metaphysics deals with things in themselves, answers to the questions of traditional metaphysics (for example, regarding God or free will) can never be answered by human minds.<br/><br/>

            As a conclusion, Kant unified most people's mental perceptions from metaphysical reality, causing a reversal to platonic logic instead of aristotelian, reverting a thousand years of progress ushered in by Thomas Aquinas and scholasticism. Politically the peaceful monarquies were endangered by the French revolution soon after and the legacy that had connected humanity until this point was partially severed.(1724ad - 1804ad)
