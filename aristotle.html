            <p>The ending of the Greek trilogy of metaphysical Philosophy could not be related to any other than Plato's greatest student, Alexander the Great's mentor and the legendary man who became the greatest philosopher of all time.<br/><br/>
                
            Aristotle, born almost 100 years after Socrates, finally put all the pieces together left behind by his predecessors and created metaphysical realism in his theory of "immanent realism" which represents the first expression of metaphysical realism as a whole, it involved an objective description of reality by pointing out that metaphysical entities have an objective external existence to our mental perception (the world of ideas depicted by Plato). In that sense, Aristotle disagreed with Plato's theory and combined both aspects, form and matter, instead of taking for granted the division between the world of ideas and the physical world proposed by his master.<br/><br/>
        
            Because of this breakthrough, we could finally comprehend metaphysical entities, all objects that surround us, exist in the physical world by themselves instead of deriving their existence from our thoughts (world of ideas).<br/><br/>
            
            Among other things, post-enlightenment relativism (see Colonial Age thinkers) supports the impossibility of achieving objective certainty, which in turn results in everything becoming a matter of mental perception regardless of facts we can deduce from metaphysical reality:<br/><br/>

            e.g. The ruler of a kingdom holds absolute power over it and decrees the sky should be described as green instead of blue under normal climatic conditions, then the population is convinced of this and ends up believing the sky should be described as green too. Would the sky actually be green now just because both the ruler and the population have agreed to call the color blue as "green" now?<br/><br/>
            
            Metaphysical Relativism solves this fast, if everyone agreed it is green, then no more discussion is needed since reality is the sum of our mental perceptions, which combined, rule over us.<br/><br/>
            
            Interestingly Aristotle answered "no" when confronted with this question, arguing the word "blue" still is an objective reference to a specific biological frequency of the human eye's visible spectrum which objectively doesn't correspond with green. But then, why is it objectively accurate to say the sky is blue, and not green?<br/><br/>
            
            Because the color blue is inherent to the existence of the metaphysical entity "sky", it has its own, specific combination of molecules and particles which make it blue.<br/><br/>

            In other words, he established that out of two mental perceptions/opinions (doxas) there will always be one that's closer in its description to metaphysical reality, namely, more objective, even by a slight margin, a single detail.<br/><br/>

            As if that was not enough, he perfected the theory of form and matter by explaining that every existing thing is a unity of form and matter. Matter itself is non-specified, and objects exist only because of form. The form is the final cause of everything. The individuality of things and phenomena appears due to the combination of the principle of form and constantly oscillating unstable matter.<br/><br/>

            The long lasting legacy of Aristotles influenced not only Alexander The Great as emperor of the Greek kingdom of Macedonia, but also the greatest empire of all time, Rome. It even made its way into middle ages when it was translated by Thomas Aquinas and arguably even today remains relevant, roughly 2500 years after all of his ideas were concieved, truly fascinating!
