            <p>One generally does not imagine that the concept of time was actually defined in the final years of the western Roman empire, yet that is the case, Saint Augustine's famous enquiry into time begins by asking: “What then is time? Provided that no one asks me, I know. If I want to explain it to an inquirer, I do not know”. <br/><br/>
                
            Even today, thousands of years after Augustine wrote these words, many of us will recognize this problem. We know how deeply embedded our lives are in time. Each day, the sun rises and then sets before nighttime comes around. We observe the tides coming in and out, the seasons changing, and even our own bodies aging over time.<br/><br/>

            All of these physical things appear to confirm that time is constantly 'passing'. But when it comes down to it, we struggle to define time because we can't actually see time itself. We can't touch it or smell it or taste it, even though our entire experience of life is so closely embedded in time. As St. Augustine remarks, when we don't have to define time, we know exactly what it is. But finding the words to describe time out loud is incredibly hard.<br/><br/>

            Augustine suggests that this is because it's only within our own minds that we perceive the presence of time. Rather than being an external, observable phenomenon, time exists within our own consciousness.<br/><br/>

            Indeed, for thousands of years, humans have tended to split time up into past, present and future. It's through these tenses that we often characterize time as 'flowing'. Without these three states, nothing around us would exist in the way we know it does. Augustine writes: “If nothing passes away, there is no past time, and if nothing arrives, there is no future time, and if nothing existed there would be no present time” (St Augustine, 2008). Time moves constantly from past to future, and we know this because of the physical changes we constantly observe. We see new things appearing all the time that weren't there before, like seeds sprouting or people walking past our window.(354ad - 430ad)</p>
