            <p>While Thomas Aquinas helped spread scholasticism, its founder was the Anselm of Canterbury, at age 23, he left his home and wandered through Burgundy and France for three years before returning to Italy (Lombardy) where he decided to become a monk at the abbey of St Stephen, Caen (northern France). After fifteen years, in 1078, Anselm was unanimously elected as Bec's abbot following the death of its founder. Then, after the norman conquest of England in 1066, anselm crossed the English channel and was elected the archbishop of Canterbury.<br/><br/>
                
            Anselm's works are considered philosophical as well as theological since they try to prove God's existence through pure rational logic. He focused on the method of dialectical reasoning to extend knowledge by inference and to resolve contradictions. Scholastic thought became known for rigorous conceptual analysis and careful drawing of distinctions, so regardles of faith, his contribution of using logic to explain even the most abstract of concepts is definitiely  monumental feat for all of humanity.<br/><br/>
        
            The legendary ontological argument to prove God's existence throguh deductive logic formulated by the Anselm of Canterbury goes as follows:<br/><br/>

            "God is, by definition, a being than which none greater can be conceived.<br/><br/>
            God exists as an idea in the mind.<br/><br/>
            A being that exists as an idea both in the mind and in reality is greater than a being that exists only as an idea in the mind.<br/><br/>
            Thus, if God exists only as an idea in the mind, then we can imagine something that is greater than God (a greatest possible being that also exists).<br/><br/>
            We cannot imagine something that is greater than God.<br/><br/>
            Therefore, God exists."<br/><br/>
    
            Philosophers have debated this argument for centuries, with many different interpretations of it. However, Anselm's version is generally considered to be best, there are 4 key points to understanding Anselm's argument:<br/><br/>
            
            - First, it is important to note that when Anselm talks about God, he is not referring to the Christian God or any other specific deity. Rather, he is talking about a being possessing all the perfections possible. In other words, God is the highest possible being that could be conceived.<br/><br/>

            - Second, it is important to understand what Anselm means by existence. For him, existence is not simply a matter of being physically present in the world. Rather, it is a property of beings that makes them greater than those who do not possess it. So, for example, a unicorn does not exist because it does not have the property of existence. However, a human exists because we have the property of existence.<br/><br/>

            - Third, it is important to note that Anselm's argument is not proof of the existence of the Christian God or any other specific deity. Rather, it is proof of the existence of a being than which none greater can be conceived. So, even if you do not believe in the Christian God, you must still concede that Anselm's argument is sound.<br/><br/>

            - Fourth and finally, it is important to understand what Anselm means by 'greater.'' In this context, greater does not simply mean 'larger' or 'more powerful.' Rather, it refers to anything that makes a being perfect or more complete. So, for example, a being that is more intelligent or more just is greater than a being that is less intelligent or less just.<br/><br/> (1033ad - 1109ad)
