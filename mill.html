            <p>Religious utilitarians looked to the Christian God to address a basic problem, namely how to harmonize the interests of individuals, who are motivated by their own happiness, with the interests of the society as a whole. Once we understand that what we must do is what God wills (because of God's power of eternal sanction) and that God wills the happiness of his creatures, morality and our own self-interest will be seen to overlap.<br/><br/>

            The second version of secular utilitarianism, and the one that inspired Mill, arose from the work of Jeremy Bentham. Bentham, who was much more successful than Godwin at building a movement around his ideas, employed the principle of utility as a device of political, social, and legal criticism. It is important to note, however, that Bentham's interest in the principle of utility did not arise from concern about ethical theory as much as from concern about legislative and legal reform.<br/><br/>

            Mill defends radical empiricism in logic and mathematics, suggesting that basic principles of logic and mathematics are generalizations from experience rather than known a priori. The principle of utility—that “actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness”(1806ad - 1873ad)
