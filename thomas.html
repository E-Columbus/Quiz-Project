            <p>Aquino is a town in southern Italy over the Tyrrhenian sea, due to its location it was relatively safer than the convulted north where all the germanic barbarians were coming from, however after a conflictive period of time in which he decided to join the Dominican Order against his family's will, Thomas Aquinas departed north to what is now Paris and Cologne to teach, then he returned to Italy to write his greatest work, the "Summa Theologica" which used a lot of the work of Aristotle, whom he greatly respected and emphasized the need to harmonize faith and reason to use both in our search for an objective moral order, or truth. He personally oversaw the translation of all of Aristotle's work with the highest degree of quality possible.<br/><br/>

            Because of Aristotle's influence, he claimed humans are rational and social by nature and that we should use our reason to pursue truth and the common good. Furthermore, he established the existence of objective moral values and that we have to uphold them. But perhaps his greatest contribution was his metaphysical conception of how reality worked by using the same logic he also learned from Anselm and Augustine's explanation of time: <br/><br/>

            In his theory of the immovable mover he states "An object cannot move on its own; it needs an impulse from another moving object. This “motor” in turn, is driven from its place by another impulse, and this series of movements can be traced back into time. But somewhere, this movement has to start. If it does not have a start, then how does the chain of events begin? This leads Thomas aquinas to conclude that God is the first cause of events, creating movement and not needing an impulse from another mover, he was defined as the immovable mover." This is incredibly similar to Aristotle's theory of Forms but regardless of personal faith one cannot deny how precise the logic of this argmuent still is after more than 800 years! <br/><br/>

            Regarding the ultimate purpose of human existence he argues that in order to make sense of any genuine action in the universe we must distinguish its goal from the various means that a being employs in order to achieve such an end, for if a being does not act for an end, then that being's acting in this or that way would be a matter of chance. Thus, for Thomas, each and every human being has an ultimate end. However, do all human beings have the same ultimate end? Thomas thinks so, and he believes that, in one sense, this should not be controversial. All human beings think of -happiness- as the ultimate end of human beings. Thomas maintains that there are objective truths about the nature of happiness, by displaying and acting accordingly to the christian moral virtues.<br/><br/>

            However, his most famous categorization probably is that of of human virtues, First, there are the rational powers of intellect and will. Although Thomas thinks that intellect enables human beings to do a number of different things, most important for the moral life is intellect's ability to allow a human being to think about actions in universal terms, that is, to think about an action as a certain kind of action, for example, a voluntary action, or as a murder, or as one done for the sake of loving God. Our ability to do this—which separates us from irrational animals, Thomas thinks—is a requisite condition for being able to act morally. Since a gorilla, we might suppose, cannot think about actions in universal terms, it cannot perform moral actions.<br/><br/>

            Secondly, Thomas also distinguishes between the apprehensive powers of the soul, that is, powers such as sense and intellect that are productive of knowledge of some sort, and the appetitive powers of the soul, which are powers that incline creatures to a certain goal or end in light of how objects are apprehended by the senses and/or intellect as desirable or undesirable. The will, according to Thomas, is an appetitive power always linked with the operation of intellect. For Thomas, intellect and will always act in tandem. Since the object of will—that is, what it is about—is being insofar as the intellect presents it as desirable, Thomas thinks of will as rational appetite. The will is therefore an inclination in rational beings towards an object or act because of what the intellect of that being presents of that object or act as something desirable or good in some way.<br/><br/>

            Following Aristotle, Thomas mentions five intellectual virtues: wisdom, understanding, science, art, and prudence. First, there are the purely speculative intellectual virtues. These intellectual virtues do not essentially aim at some practical effect but rather aim simply at the consideration of truth. Understanding is the speculative intellectual virtue concerning the consideration of first principles, that is, those propositions that are known through themselves and not by way of deduction from other propositions, for example, the principle of non-contradiction, and propositions such as all mammals are animals and it is morally wrong to kill an innocent person intentionally. Wisdom is the intellectual virtue that involves the ability to think truly about the highest causes, for example, God and other matters treated in metaphysics. As we saw in the section on the nature of knowledge and science above, science is the intellectual ability to draw correct conclusions from first principles within a particular subject domain, for example, there is the science of physics, which is the ability to draw correct conclusions from the first principles of being qua material being.<br/><br/>

            Adhering to realism, he thinks that all human beings who have reached the age of reason and received at least an elementary moral education have a kind of moral knowledge, namely, a knowledge of universal moral principles. e.g: one should do good and avoid evil. Such universal principles are known to be true by every human person who has reached the age of reason without fail.<br/><br/>

            Lastly, besides metaphysics we must remember that Thomas Aquinas lived during the crusades and he also contributed with the concept of "just war" that would further shape the french and spanish 'reconquistas' by the righteous crusaders who drove the moor invaders out of the iberian peninsula. 3 conditions were required for the pope to call on the crusaders to wage a just war based on Thomas's thoughts, which definitely played a role since he was the most respected advisor in all of the Vatican:<br/><br/>
            
            1 - war must occur for the common good rather than the pursuit of wealth or power.<br/><br/>
            2 - war must be waged by a properly instituted authority.<br/><br/>
            3 - Peace must be a central motive even in the midst of violence.<br/><br/>

            Due to its strong emphasis on reason, objective truth, and the dignity of the human person, thomism offers a much-needed counterbalance to the prevailing trends of relativism and nihilism as well as a valuable perspective on creating a just and thriving society. For these reasons, Thomism is a philosophy that is well worth studying and considering in todays modern world. (1225ad - 1274ad)
