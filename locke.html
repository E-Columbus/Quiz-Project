            <p>Some years before the rise of Kantian relativism, there was a fight between two different stances, British empiricists and European continental rationalists, which was a new revival of the old clash between platonic vs aristotelian metaphysics just like Thomas Aquinas and William of Ockham in the 1200's.<br/><br/>        
   
            The best recognized and most commonly made distinction between rationalists and empiricists concerns the question of the source of ideas. Whereas rationalists tend to think that some ideas, at least, such as the idea of God, are innate, empiricists hold that all ideas come from experience of the senses.<br/><br/>
            
            In that context John Locke is the father of british empiricism, He uses evidence from travel literature to point out that many non-Europeans deny what were taken to be innate moral maxims and that some groups even lack the idea of a God. Locke takes the fact that not all humans have these ideas as evidence that they were not implanted by God in humans minds, and that they are therefore acquired rather than innate.<br/><br/>

            There is one misunderstanding which it is important to avoid when considering Locke's anti-nativism. The misunderstanding is, in part, suggested by Locke's claim that the mind is like a tabula rasa (a blank slate) prior to sense experience. This makes it sound as though the mind is nothing prior to the advent of ideas. In fact, Locke's position is much more nuanced. He makes it clear that the mind has any number of inherent capacities, predispositions, and inclinations prior to receiving any ideas from sensation. His anti-nativist point is just that none of these is triggered or exercised until the mind receives ideas from sensation.<br/><br/>

            Every day we think of complex things like orange juice, castles, justice, numbers, and motion. Locke's claim is that the ultimate origin of all of these ideas lies in experience: “Experience: In that, all our Knowledge is founded; and from that it ultimately derives itself. Our Observation employed either about external, sensible Objects; or about the internal Operations of our Minds, perceived and reflected on by ourselves, is that, which supplies our Understandings with all the material of thinking. These two are the Fountains of Knowledge, from whence all the Ideas we have, or can naturally have, do spring.”.<br/><br/>

            In the above passage Locke allows for two distinct types of experience. Outer experience, or sensation, provides us with ideas from the traditional five senses. Sight gives us ideas of colors, hearing gives us ideas of sounds, and so on. Thus, my idea of a particular shade of green is a product of seeing a fern. And my idea of a particular tone is the product of my being in the vicinity of a piano while it was being played. Inner experience, or reflection, is slightly more complicated. Locke thinks that the human mind is incredibly active; it is constantly performing what he calls operations. For example, I often remember past birthday parties, imagine that I was on vacation, desire a slice of pizza, or doubt that England will win the World Cup. Locke believes that we are able to notice or experience our mind performing these actions and when we do we receive ideas of reflection. These are ideas such as memory, imagination, desire, doubt, judgment, and choice.<br/><br/>

            By accepting the aristotelian legacy and combining it with some of his ideas, Locke became the last prominent realist thinker before the advent of relativism.(1632ad - 1704ad)
