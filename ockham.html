            <p>Historically, Ockham has been cast as the outstanding opponent of Thomas Aquinas, who perfected the great “medieval synthesis” of faith and reason and was canonized by the Catholic Church; Ockham argued against it and was condemned by the Catholic Church. Although it is true that Aquinas and Ockham disagreed on most issues, Aquinas had many other critics, and Ockham did not criticize Aquinas any more than he did others, regardless of this we can affirm that besides Aristotle's original work, the battle between Ockham and Aquinas in interpreting Aristotle's work is the second most important philosophical event in History without a doubt.<br/><br/>
                
            The principle of simplicity is the central theme of Ockham's approach, so much so that this principle has come to be known as “Ockham's Razor” Ockham constantly applies this to eliminate unnecessary hypotheses. One of the most basic challenges in metaphysics is to explain how it is that things are the same despite differences. The Greek philosopher Heraclitus points out that you can never step into the same river twice, referring not just to rivers, but to places, people, and life itself. Every day everything changes a little bit and everywhere you go you find new things. Heraclitus concludes from such observations that nothing ever remains the same. All reality is in flux.<br/><br/>

            The problem with seeing the world this way is that it leads to radical skepticism: if nothing stays the same from moment to moment and from place to place, then we can never really be certain about anything. We cannot know our friends or the very world we live in. Moreover, if Heraclitus is right, it seems science is impossible. We could learn the properties of a chemical here today and still have no basis for knowing its properties someplace else tomorrow.<br/><br/>
                
            Needless to say, most people would prefer to avoid skepticism. It's hard to carry on in a state of complete ignorance. Besides, it seems obvious that science is not impossible. Studying the world really does enable us to know how things are over time and across distances. The fact that things change through time and vary from place to place does not seem to prevent us from having knowledge. From this, some philosophers, such as Plato and Augustine, draw the conclusion that Heraclitus was wrong to suppose that everything is in flux. Something has to stay the same, something that lays underneath the changing and varying surfaces we perceive, namely, the universal essence of things.<br/><br/>
                
            For example, although individual human beings change from day to day and vary from place to place, they all share the universal essence of humanity, which is eternally the same. Likewise for dogs, trees, rocks, and even qualities—there must be a universal essence of blueness, heat, love, and anything else one can think of. Universal essences are not physical realities; if you dissect a human being, you will not find humanity inside like a kidney or a lung! Nevertheless, universal essences are metaphysical realities: they provide the invisible structure of things.<br/><br/>
                
            Belief in universal essences, metaphysical realism, asserts that universal essences are real even though we cannot physically see them. Although there are various different versions of metaphysical realism, they are all designed to secure a foundation for knowledge. It seems you have a choice: either you accept metaphysical realism or you are stuck with skepticism.<br/><br/>
                
            Ockham, however, argues that this is a false dilemma. He rejects both metaphysical realism and skepticism (relativism) in favor of nominalism: the view that universal essences are concepts in the mind. While earlier nominalists such as the French philosopher Roscelin had advanced the more radical view that universal essences are just names that have no basis in reality (relativism). Ockham developed a more sophisticated version of nominalism often called “conceptualism” because it holds that universal essences are concepts caused in our minds when we perceive real similarities among things in the world.<br/><br/>

            For example, when a child comes in contact with different human beings over time, he begins to form the concept of humanity. A realist would say that he has detected the invisible common structure of these individuals. Ockham, in contrast, insists that the child has merely perceived similarities that fit naturally under one concept.<br/><br/>
        
            However, despite disagreeing with Thomas Aquinas on a lot of things, hence why Ockham is usually referred to as "The First Protestant", it should be strongly highlighted that he still is not a relativist but a moderate nominalist and direct realist, he just does not believe in universal essences outside the mind really existing in individual substances, but still affirms the existence of an objective metaphysical reality, thus not being a  relativist. (which implies indirect realism, we only perceive a copy of the world in our minds provided by our cognitive senses, but not the original version, Ockham never denied perceiving the original version of reality).
