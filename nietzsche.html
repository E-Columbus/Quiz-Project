            <p>The cycle of relativism started by Kant had deep unforseen consecuences, "God is Dead" is a famous quote that bred something as terrible as nihilism, stating that human existence didn't have a purpose in itself, all by the hand of Nietzsche guided by Kant's relativism.<br/><br/>

            There's a direct correlation between nihilism and World War I and II, when human life has no purpose, what prevents National socialism from absorbing individuals's freedoms and capabilities? nothing. Proving that national socialist stances like the french revolution or those behind two world wars were socially progressive in the context of the "death of old idols" like Nietzche said, as opposed to metaphysical realism embodied in the old conservative monarchies that remained stable.<br/><br/>

            With the fulfillment of European nihilism and the death of otherworldly hopes for redemption, Nietzsche imagines two possible responses:  the easy response, the way of the “herd” and “the last man,” or the difficult response, the way of the “exception,” and the Übermensch.<br/><br/>

            Ancillary to any discussion of the exception, per se, the compatibility of the Übermensch concept with other movements in Nietzsche's thought, and even the significance that Nietzsche himself placed upon it, has been the subject of intense debate among Nietzsche scholars. The term's appearance in Nietzsche's corpus is limited primarily to Thus Spoke Zarathustra and works directly related to this text. Even here, moreover, the Übermensch is only briefly and very early announced in the narrative, albeit with a tremendous amount of fanfare, before fading from explicit consideration. In addition to these problems, there are debates concerning the basic nature of the Übermensch itself, whether “Über-” refers to a transitional movement or a transmogrified state of being, and whether Nietzsche envisioned the possibility of a community of Übermenschen, as opposed to a solitary figure among lesser types. So, what should be made of Nietzsche's so-called “overman” (or even “superman”) called upon to arrive after the “death of God”?<br/><br/>

            Whatever else may be said about the Übermensch, Nietzsche clearly had in mind an exemplary figure and an exception among humans, one “whose inexhaustible fertility and power keep up the faith in man.” For some commentators, Nietzsche's distinction between overman and the last man has political ramifications. The hope for an overman figure to appear would seem to be permissible for one individual, many, or even a social ideal, depending on the culture within which it appears. Modernity, in Nietzsche's view, is in such a state of decadence that it would be fortunate, indeed, to see the emergence of even one such type, given that modern sociopolitical arrangements are more conducive to creating the egalitarian “last man” who “blinks” at expectations for rank, self-overcoming, and striving for greatness. The last men are “ the most harmful to the species because they preserve their existence as much at the expense of the truth as at the expense of the future” (“Why I am a Destiny” in Ecce Homo 1). Although Nietzsche never lays out a precise political program from these ideas, it is at least clear that theoretical justifications for complacency or passivity are antithetical to his philosophy. What, then, may be said about Nietzsche as political thinker? Nietzsche's political sympathies are definitely not democratic in any ordinary way of thinking about that sort of arrangement.(1844ad - 1900ad)
