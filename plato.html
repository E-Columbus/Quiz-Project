            <p>Without his master, Plato was all but alone in our quest to find. Needless to say confronting the sophists openly was not an option for him at the time, so instead he wrote in solace his master's life experience in the form of his famous platonic dialogues between two individuals while posing a problem to solve. It should be noted that most of what we know nowadays of Socrates is actually extracted from Plato's writings, which only contributes to admire his tenacity in keeping the legacy of his master alive.<br/><br/>

            But Plato also contributed to society on his own once we could have his academy in Athens, his most prominent discovery was the division between the world of ideas and the world of reality, the former actually being our own mind, of course since biology was not advanced enough as to explain how our brain produced thoughts it was considered a sort of astral plane our minds were connected to, and the later being the physical world around us.<br/><br/>
            
            While the concept of metaphysical realism and a conclusive definition of reality were not yet complete at this point, Plato did establish the stepping stone for it by creating this division between our mental perception (doxa) and objective metaphysical entities that populate the external, physical world that surrounds us, this was called "Theory of Forms".
