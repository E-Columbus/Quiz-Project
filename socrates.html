            <p>Philosophy as a whole was created by Socrates, Pre-socratic thinkers were actually mere "Sophists", a hyrid role which combined being teachers and attorneys, imagine their surprise when a man single-handedly challenged the predominant idea at the time of believing in how you said something being more important than the content of what you were saying, he emphasized manners and sophistication were not as crucial as the logic behind our arguments for the first time in History.<br/><br/>

            As time passed, his teachings at the greek Agora (equivalent of a public park) attracted students from all parts of the Acropolis (city-state), among his valuable lessons we remember even today is his legendary phrase "All I know is that I know nothing" which sparked irony in society altogether while at the same time creating the Socratic method of teaching through it how realization of our own ignorance is the first step on the road to wisdom.<br/><br/>

            Of course the sophists were not happy with this development and started to publicly clash with him and his newly adopted students at the Agora, since both groups acted as arbiters in several cases that used to commonly arise back then (eg: a tree dropping its fruits on the garden of a neighbour and defining who was the owner of it).<br/><br/>
            
            As expected, the cryptic enigmas of socratic irony combined with the revolutionary idea of putting the focus of public discussions on the content rather than the manners proved to be way too advanced for most minds to the point sophists felt ridiculed and he was eventually accused of poisoning people's minds and sentenced to death by the genex tribunal, a jury composed of the oldest citizens of the Acropolis, who were all mere sophists indeed.<br/><br/>

            As tragic as Socrates's ending may be, he left behind a long-lasting legacy on society that would be silently picked up by his greatest student...
