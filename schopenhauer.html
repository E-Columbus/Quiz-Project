            <p>So what happened after Kant? besides Nietzche and two world wars derived from relativism, the epitome of this long line of nihilistic relativists is Arthur Schopenhauer<br/><br/>
            
            The starting point for his metaphysics is Immanuel Kant's system of transcendental idealism as explained in The Critique of Pure Reason. Although Schopenhauer is quite critical of much of the content of Kant's Transcendental Analytic, he endorses Kant's approach to metaphysics in Kant's limiting the sphere of metaphysics to articulating the conditions of experience rather than transcending the bounds of experience. In addition, he accepts the results of the Transcendental Aesthetic, which demonstrate the truth of transcendental idealism. Like Kant, Schopenhauer argues that the phenomenal world is a representation, i.e., an object for the subject conditioned by the forms of our cognition. At the same time, Schopenhauer simplifies the activity of the Kantian cognitive apparatus by holding that all cognitive activity occurs according to the principle of sufficient reason, that is, that nothing is without a reason for being.<br/><br/>

            Hence, the title of Schopenhauer's major work, The World as Will and Representation, aptly summarizes his metaphysical system. The world is the world of representation, as a spatio-temporal universal of individuated objects, a world constituted by our own cognitive apparatus.<br/><br/>
    
            So this is how we ended up witnessing the two greatest conflicts in the History of humanity, directly influenced by French and Prussian (German) socialism, relativism and nihilism. However, metaphysical realism was stil alive out there, in an unexpected, new wonderful land composed originally of british outcasts who still wanted to believe in objectiveness, the United States of America. The true inheritor of British empiricism, Italian Thomism, and the immortal legacy of aristotelian metaphysical realism, for in the end realism and trust defeated relativism and doubt, as they always will.(1788ad - 1860ad)
